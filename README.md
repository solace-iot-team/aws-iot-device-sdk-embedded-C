The Solace MQTT IoT SDK provides secure MQTT connectivity on the IoT Accelerator Device Platform. It includes an example on how to utilise the Telus SIM Secure Storage element to establish a TLS connection to Solace Cloud.

It is based on [aws-iot Embedded C Device SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/) and includes the following modifications:

* Removed AWS IoT Hub specific features - Device Shadow, Jobs
* Removed samples, tests
* Added mbedTLS source code, v [2.17](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/tree/mbedtls-2.17)
* Added support to pass in Root CA,Device Certificate and Device Key to the library rather than reading from files
* Added example of how to access the Telus Secure Storage to read certificates and keys and pass these into the MQTT client library to establish a TLS connection

Changes have been added to the master branch of this repository.

Find a getting started tutorial below, the original release branch [readme.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/release/README.md) applies.

## Prerequisites
### Set up the hardware and modem connectivity
See this [tutorial](https://github.com/TELUS-Emerging-IoT/TELUS-Devkit-Hardware-Tutorial/blob/master/README.md)

### Obtain Telus Modem / SCC Toolkit API
The library is provided in a ZIP file, unzip and change into the directory where you unzipped the contents.
Then copy SCC Toolkit library components to the Raspberry PI via SCP.
Headers from folder `inc` to `/usr/include` on the raspberry pi, `libscc-toolkit.so` and `libscc-toolkit.a` to `/usr/lib` on the Raspberry PI.

### Optional - Apply BlackBerry security patch to Raspbian
TBC - add link

### Optional - provision certificates and keys onto the secure storage
The repository contains a sample application () that uploads files to the secure storage.
Participants wil be either provided with a pre-configured SIM or will be supplied with the device certificate, key and Digicert Rooot CA Certificate for Solace Cloud.

## Development directly on Device
Source code is provided as is with a sample make file. No further instrucitons are available at this point.

## Set up Eclipse Development Environment
### Install Eclipse for C/CPP
Download and install Eclipse [IDE for C/C++ Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-03/r/eclipse-ide-cc-developers) for your platform.

### Obtain and install Raspberry Pi Tool Chain
Tool chains for different platforms are available:
* Windows: http://gnutoolchains.com/raspberry/
* MacOS (verified during SDK adaption): download [ZIP](https://github.com/yc2986/armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-8.1.0-macos-high-sierra/archive/master.zip), also see [github](https://github.com/yc2986/armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-8.1.0-macos-high-sierra) and [documentation](https://medium.com/coinmonks/setup-gcc-8-1-cross-compiler-toolchain-for-raspberry-pi-3-on-macos-high-sierra-cb3fc8b6443e).
* Linux: https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/tree/master/arm-bcm2708

Instructions on setting up a cross compile tool chain for RaspBerry PI in Eclipse - (https://dontpressthat.wordpress.com/2017/11/15/using-eclipse-to-write-c-c-programs-for-the-raspberrypi/)


### Set up remote debugging using GDB

Eclipse includes support to create remote debug configurations that execute applications via SSH and GDB on a target system. This requires GDB server to run on the Raspberry PI.
Install gdbserver on Raspberry PI, execute the following commands on the Raspberry PI:

```
$ sudo apt-get install gdbserver

$ gdbserver --multi 192.168.0.131:2345
```

(http://geomodule.com/sw-eng-notes/2017/03/25/raspberry-pi-debugging-with-gdb-command-line/)

### Import required libraries from Raspberry PI

In order to compile code that relies on libraries installed on the Raspberry PI these need to be added to the Tool Chain.
The basic process is explained here: (https://raspberry-projects.com/pi/programming-in-c/compilers-and-ides/eclipse/adding-libraries-to-eclipse-for-windows)

The sample application requires Wiring PI to interact with the shield's user button and LED.
Add the header files and libraries to the toolchain as described above, obtain these from the raspberry PI via SCP:
```
$ scp {user}@{host or ip}:/usr/lib/libwiringPi* {local toolchain sysroot/usr/lib directory}
$ scp {user}@{host or ip}:/usr/include/wiringPi* {local toolchain sysroot/usr/include directory}
```

The SCC Toolkit requires libpcsclite, as above please obtian these files via SCP:
```
$ scp {user}@{host or ip}:/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpcsclite.* {local toolchain sysroot/usr/lib directory}

```
Copy SCC Toolkit library components to your `sysroot` directory, headers from folder `inc` to `sysroot/usr/include`, `libscc-toolkit.so` and `libscc-toolkit.a` to `sysroot/usr/lib`

## SDK and Sample Installation
This section explains the individual steps to retrieve the necessary SDK files and be able to build the sample application.

Steps:

 * Download the released ZIP from https://github.com/solace-iot-team/solace-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/releases/tag/v0.9.2
 * Unzip the file to a new directory
 * Import application into Eclipse

## Running the sample application

### Setup Connectivity & Security
* Locate the file `aws_iot_config.h`
* Replace `AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST`
* If you provisioned the certificates and key under different keys in the secure storage adjust AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_FILENAME, AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_FILENAME, AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME

```
// =================================================
#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST              "mrjfgwkeg1cer.messaging.solace.cloud" ///< Customer specific MQTT HOST.
#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT              8883 ///< default port for MQTT/S
#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_CLIENT_ID         "default" ///< MQTT client ID should be unique for every device
#define AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_FILENAME       "digicert-ca" ///< Root CA file name
#define AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_FILENAME   "device-cert" ///< device signed certificate file name
#define AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME   "device-private-key" ///< Device private key filename
```
### Create a remote debug configuration
In Eclipse add a new Debug Configuration:
![Eclipse debug](assets/images/06_Eclipse_DebugSetup.png)
